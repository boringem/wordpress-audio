# wordpress-audio
a wordpress audio player designed to work with a custom theme, and play audio files based on a tag. 

# how it works
I needed two different pages to play different audio files; this is the studio work version. It filters audio 
uploads by a meta tag, and runs a javascript music player that displays the artist and track information next to the track. 

# live demo 
You can view the player right here: https://madelynv.sgedu.site/studio-work/ 
The overall theme is still in progress, but the studio work page functions as it should
